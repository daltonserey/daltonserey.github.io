The religious approach to while True loops.

How loops can be classified according to exit points: for and
true while loops, do while and repeat until loops and loop leave
or half loops (or loop and a half). 

How easier it is to write the loop leave. How easy it is to learn
the loop leave. The benefits of the loop leave when thinking
about loops (everything that repeats go inside the loop body;
anything that doesn't repeat go outside). Implementing loop
leave with while True. The problem with if..break as a substitute
for the leave if .. construct (the problem is that before a break
some code can be added; while this may seem convenient, it leads
to bad code, because there will be code that runs only once
within the loop body).

Find and add references: Knuth, Dijkstra, etc.

Find real code with while True.

Mention different ways to implement it in different languages. 

A parentheses: C doesn't have real for loops. Strictly speaking,
all it has is a for-like syntax for while loops. The best for
syntax ever: algol!
