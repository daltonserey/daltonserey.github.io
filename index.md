# Dalton Serey, UFCG

I am a professor in the [Computer Science
Department](http://www.computacao.ufcg.edu.br) at the
[Universidade Federal de Campina Grande](http://www.ufcg.edu.br),
Brazil. I am also the director and one the the researchers of the
[Software Practices
Laboratory](http://splab.computacao.ufcg.edu.br/).

My academic interests are in teaching and researching computer
programming and software engineer, with a focus on human and
social aspects. I am a very impatient person and thus I prefer
research that can be applied soon and as close to me as possible.
