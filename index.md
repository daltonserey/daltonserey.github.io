# Dalton Serey, Computação@UFCG

I am a professor in the [Computer Science
Department](http://www.computacao.ufcg.edu.br) at the
[Universidade Federal de Campina Grande](http://www.ufcg.edu.br),
Brazil. I am a former director and now one the researchers of the
[Software Practices
Laboratory](http://splab.computacao.ufcg.edu.br/).

My academic interests are in computer programming, programming
languages, concurrent and parallel programming and computation,
software engineering and computers and education. I am quite
impatient and therefore I prefer research topics and projects
that can be applied as soon and as close to me as possible.
